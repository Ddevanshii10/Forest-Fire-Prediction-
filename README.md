FOREST FIRE PREDICTIONðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

ABOUT THE PROJECTðŸ”Ž
Objective: Predict the Forest Weather Index (FWI) for forest fire risk assessment using meteorological parameters like temperature, rainfall, ISI, wind speed, etc.
Data: Trained on the Algerian Forest Fire dataset containing historical weather conditions and forest fire incidents.
Approach: Explored and engineered relevant features, trained various regression models (Simple, Lasso, Ridge) on the data, with Ridge Regression providing the best predictive performance.
Deployment: Deployed on Azure.
